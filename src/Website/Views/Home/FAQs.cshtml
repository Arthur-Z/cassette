        <dl>
                <dt><a href="#" class="helpquestion">Why does Cassette have a dual license?</a></dt>
                <dd class="helpanswer"><p>We're passionate about Open Source software and want to support it - so Cassette is free for other Open Source
                projects to use, and the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/andrewdavey/cassette" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for everyone 
                to look at, tweak and improve.</p>
                <p>We're also passionate about Cassette, and want it to be a viable, sustainable project for the long-term. 
                Our proprietary licenses help support the development of Cassette - we hope that if Cassette helps your business save time/work/money/stress, 
                the expense will be worthwhile. Feel differently? <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cassette" target="_blank">Join the discussion</a>.</p></dd>
                
                <dt><a href="#" class="helpquestion">How do we change our license to include more servers?</a></dt>
                <dd class="helpanswer"><p>You can buy additional licenses for more servers at any time, as you need them. If you reach 15 servers in total, we'll 
                automatically upgrade you to an Unlimited license, and you'll receive 12 month priority live support as well.</p></dd>

                <dt><a href="#" class="helpquestion">What license should I buy if I'm using cloud hosting?</a></dt>
                <dd class="helpanswer"><p>Deploying your application into Azure, EC2 or some other cloud host? The Unlimited Cassette license is probably the 
                best fit. You can scale out any number of servers and you'll receive priority live support. You could also buy a license for the maximum number 
                of servers you're likely to be using, and buy additional licenses later if and when you need them.</p>
